# Fashion Store

The fashion store is a simple e-commerce clothing application made in Flutter & Dart which uses a basic understanding of Provider (used for state management). This project uses [FakeStoreApi](http://fakestoreapi.com/docs) for fetching the details of the products.

## Motivation
This project will help the early flutter developers to understand how to follow proper Flutter/Dart guidelines and Architecture. It will also help them understand the working of a State Management widget like Provider.
